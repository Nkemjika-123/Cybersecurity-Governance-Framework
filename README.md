## 1. Executive Summary  
This report presents a complete cybersecurity governance and compliance strategy for a simulated Nigerian government healthcare agency.  
The initial risk assessment, conducted on a vulnerable Metasploitable 2 server, revealed a critical security posture with multiple high-risk vulnerabilities, including remote code execution flaws in key services (vsFTPd, Samba, Apache Tomcat) and weak authentication mechanisms.
The findings indicate a high risk of data breach, system compromise, and significant non-compliance with major regulatory frameworks including the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR 2019), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ISO 27001:2022, and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

This report consolidates my response into a three-pillar approach: 

(1) Immediate technical remediation of critical vulnerabilities
(2) Establishment of robust governance policies for risk management, data security and auditing and 
(3) A detailed implementation and continuous monitoring plan. 
The provided roadmap is designed to systematically elevate the agency's security posture, protect sensitive patient data, and ensure ongoing regulatory compliance.

## 2. Introduction & Project Objectives  
The digital transformation of healthcare brings immense benefits but also significant risks, especially concerning sensitive patient data. This project simulates a real-world scenario to identify gaps and build a resilient cybersecurity governance structure.

## Primary Objectives:

**â€¢	Identify & Assess:** Discover and evaluate cybersecurity vulnerabilities within the agency's simulated infrastructure.

**â€¢	Govern & Comply:** Develop policies and strategies aligned with NDPR, GDPR, ISO 27001, and NIST CSF to address identified risks.

**â€¢	Implement & Monitor:** Create a phased action plan for remediation, ongoing auditing, and continuous improvement to ensure sustained compliance and security.

## 3. Risk Assessment Summary  

  A thorough vulnerability assessment was performed, revealing a severely compromised initial state.
  
**Key Findings:**

**â€¢	Critical Vulnerabilities:** Multiple services were configured with critical flaws allowing unauthorized access and full system control.

- **vsFTPd 2.3.4 Backdoor (CVE-2011-2523):** Critical (CVSS 9.8) - Allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code.
 
- **Samba usermap script Remote Command Execution (RCE (CVE-2007-2447)):** Critical (CVSS 10.0) - Allows remote command execution.
 
- **Apache Tomcat 5.5:** Critical - Multiple legacy exploits leading to information disclosure and RCE(Remote Code Execution).
 
- **MySQL Auth Bypass (CVE-2012-2122):** High - Could allow attackers to bypass authentication.
 
**â€¢	Poor Security Practices:** Anonymous FTP logins, unencrypted Telnet services, and weak encryption (SSLv2) were prevalent, violating core principles of confidentiality and integrity.

**â€¢	Compliance Gaps:** The state of the systems directly violates multiple articles and controls of NDPR, GDPR, ISO 27001, and NIST CSF, particularly concerning patch management, access control, and data protection.

**Top Risk Summary Table:**

| Vulnerability | CVE ID | CVSS Score | Risk Level | Compliance Impact |
|--------------|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------------|
| vsFTPd 2.3.4 Backdoor | CVE-2011-2523 | 9.8 (Critical) | **Critical** | NDPR 2.6, GDPR Art. 32, ISO A.8.8 |
| Samba RCE | CVE-2007-2447 | 10.0 (Critical) | **Critical** | NDPR 2.6, GDPR Art. 32, ISO A.8.8 |
| Anonymous FTP Login | N/A | 7.5 (High) | **Critical** | NDPR 2.6, GDPR Art. 25/32 |
| Apache HTTPD Vulns | Multiple | 7.5 (High) | **Critical** | NDPR 2.6, ISO A.8.8 |
| Tomcat 5.5 RCE | Multiple | 9.0 (Critical) | **Critical** | NDPR 2.6, ISO A.8.8 |

**Poor Security Practices Identified:**  
- Anonymous FTP access  
- Unencrypted Telnet  
- Outdated software (Apache, MySQL)  
- Weak encryption (SSLv2)

A phased approach is designed for effective execution with minimal disruption.

![Cybersecurity Governance Framework](flow-diagram.jpg)

**Phase 1:** Immediate Remediation (Weeks 1â€“2)  

**â€¢	Actions:** Disable anonymous FTP and Telnet(use only for testing or validatiion). 

Apply available patches for vsFTPd, Samba, Apache, and MySQL. 

Isolate critical databases.

**â€¢	Owner:** IT Security Team & System Administrators.


**Phase 2:** Control Implementation (Weeks 3â€“4)
