## 1. Executive Summary  
This report presents a complete cybersecurity governance and compliance strategy for a simulated Nigerian government healthcare agency.  
The initial risk assessment, conducted on a vulnerable Metasploitable 2 server, revealed a critical security posture with multiple high-risk vulnerabilities, including remote code execution flaws in key services (vsFTPd, Samba, Apache Tomcat) and weak authentication mechanisms.
The findings indicate a high risk of data breach, system compromise, and significant non-compliance with major regulatory frameworks including the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation (NDPR 2019), the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), ISO 27001:2022, and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

This report consolidates my response into a three-pillar approach: 

(1) Immediate technical remediation of critical vulnerabilities
(2) Establishment of robust governance policies for risk management, data security and auditing and 
(3) A detailed implementation and continuous monitoring plan. 
The provided roadmap is designed to systematically elevate the agency's security posture, protect sensitive patient data, and ensure ongoing regulatory compliance.

## 2. Introduction & Project Objectives  
The digital transformation of healthcare brings immense benefits but also significant risks, especially concerning sensitive patient data.  

**Primary Objectives:**  
- **Identify & Assess:** Discover and evaluate cybersecurity vulnerabilities within the simulated infrastructure.  
- **Govern & Comply:** Develop policies aligned with **NDPR, GDPR, ISO 27001, NIST CSF**.  
- **Implement & Monitor:** Create a phased remediation and auditing plan.

- **Key Provisions:**  
  - Regular vulnerability scans  
  - Risk register with Likelihood/Impact matrix  
  - SLA-based remediation timelines (Critical: 1 week, High: 2 weeks)  
- **Compliance Mapping:** NIST CSF ID.RA-01â€“04, ISO 27001 A.8.8, GDPR Art. 32  

### 4.2 Data Security Policy  
- **Purpose:** Protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of patient data.  
- **Key Provisions:**  
  - AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.2+ in transit  
  - RBAC enforcement  
  - Secure data disposal procedures  
  - Breach notification within 72 hours  
- **Compliance Mapping:** NDPR Sec. 2.1 & 4.2, GDPR Art. 5, 25, 32, 33, 34  

### 4.3 Auditing & Compliance Policy  
- **Purpose:** Ensure accountability and ongoing compliance.  
- **Key Provisions:**  
  - Quarterly internal audits  
  - Annual ISO 27001/GDPR compliance checks  
  - Management review of results  
- **Compliance Mapping:** GDPR Art. 5(2), ISO 27001 A.18.2.3

## 5. Implementation & Auditing Plan  

**Phase 1:** Immediate Remediation (Weeks 1â€“2)  
- Disable anonymous FTP, Telnet  
- Patch vsFTPd, Samba, Apache, MySQL  

**Phase 2:** Control Implementation (Weeks 3â€“4)  
- Enforce password policy & RBAC  
- Configure TLS for web/SMTP  
- Deploy Splunk/Syslog  

**Phase 3:** Monitoring & Auditing (Ongoing)  
- Weekly vulnerability scans  
- Monthly compliance audits  
- Quarterly penetration tests  

**KPIs:**  
- % of Critical Vulns Patched within SLA  
- % of Systems with Encryption Enforced  
- of Audit Findings per Cycle

## 6. Actionable Recommendations & Roadmap  

| Priority | Recommendation | Framework Mapping | Timeline |
|---------|----------------|------------------|---------|
| **Critical** | Establish formal patch mgmt program | ISO 27001 A.8.8, NIST PR.IP | Immediate |
| **Critical** | Disable insecure services (FTP, Telnet) | GDPR Art. 32, NIST PR.AC-5 | Immediate |
| **High** | Implement network segmentation | ISO 27001 A.8.22 | 1â€“2 Weeks |

## 7. Conclusion  
This framework provides a **clear roadmap** to move the agency from a **high-risk state** to a **resilient, compliant, and secure infrastructure**.  
Adopting these measures will:  
- Reduce attack surface  
- Protect patient data  
- Demonstrate compliance with NDPR, GDPR, ISO 27001, and NIST CSF  

**Next Steps:**  
- Immediate execution of Phase 1 remediation  
- Continuous monitoring & quarterly governance board reporting  
- Building a culture of security and compliance
